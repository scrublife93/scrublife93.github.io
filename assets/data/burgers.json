The highlight of the experience is the bun; it is remarkably fluffy, flavorful, and maintains its structural integrity against the weight of the ingredients. While the patty provides a deep, savory taste, the exterior was slightly over-seared, leading to a dry texture. Additionally, the meat was oversized for the bun, causing a bit of a mismatch in the presentation and packaging. The signature sauce leans into a bold, cocktail-style profile that offers a sharp kick, though it risks being a bit dominant for those who prefer the beef to take center stage. It remains a well-balanced and satisfying option for anyone seeking a quality smash burger in the city.",

A refreshing twist comes from the substitution of standard pickles for fresh cucumber slices, lending a clean, crisp finish to every bite. The sauce complements the meat without overwhelming it, though it stops short of having a signature distinction.
