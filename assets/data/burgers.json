The standout feature is undoubtedly the bun, which offers a delightful, fluffy texture that far exceeds expectations. Though the aroma might remind some of classic fast-food chains, the quality is vastly superior and serves as a highlight of the meal. The meat is expertly seasoned and features a satisfyingly crunchy exterior, providing a robust base even though it lacks a highly distinctive signature flavor. Complemented by a well-balanced sauce that carries a pleasant hint of cocktail notes, the overall composition is both enjoyable and satisfying. Priced at 23 CHF, it stands as a premium option for burger enthusiasts in the city. While it leans towards traditional flavors rather than groundbreaking ones, the technical execution of the meat and bread makes this a highly recommended experience.",

Additionally, the meat was oversized for the bun, causing a bit of a mismatch in the presentation and packaging. The signature sauce leans into a bold, cocktail-style profile that offers a sharp kick, though it risks being a bit dominant for those who prefer the beef to take center stage.
